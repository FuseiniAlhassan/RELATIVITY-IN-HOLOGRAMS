# RELATIVITY-IN-HOLOGRAMS

A Python project to simulate holographic reconstruction of relativistic objects, combining optics, quantum effects, and special relativity. The project generates dynamic holograms, reconstructs 3D object fields, and visualizes entanglement metrics in real-time.
ðŸŒ€ **Fun fact:** To me, coding feels like wave interference, sometimes constructive, sometimes destructive but physics is always the best lens to reveal the hidden beauty of the universe.
Features

3D Object Simulation: Sphere, Torus, and Hypercube objects in rest and moving frames.

Relativistic Effects: Lorentz transformations, length contraction, and Doppler-shifted quantum phases.

Hologram Generation: Computes interference patterns including material response and polarization.

Reconstruction: Simulates wave propagation and reconstructs 3D object fields from holograms.

Quantum Metrics: Computes entanglement entropy for the simulated objects.

Interactive Visualization:

Sliders for velocity (Î² = v/c) and reconstruction distance.

Buttons to animate, reset, and switch object shapes.

Real-time display of hologram, reconstruction, Fourier spectrum, spacetime correlation, and quantum phase.

Output: Saves snapshots and animations automatically.

Installation

Clone the repository:


Install required packages (Python 3.9+ recommended):

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
# Optional GPU acceleration
pip install cupy

Usage

Run the main simulation:

python "Relativity in Holography.py"


Interact with the sliders and buttons to explore object motion, hologram reconstruction, and quantum metrics.

**Future Work**

Incorporate more complex shapes and materials.

GPU-accelerated reconstruction for larger holograms.

Integration with deep learning for improved hologram reconstruction.

Extend to simulate optical cloaking or invisibility effects.
