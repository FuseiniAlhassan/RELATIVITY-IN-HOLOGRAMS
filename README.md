# RELATIVITY-IN-HOLOGRAMS

A Python project to simulate holographic reconstruction of relativistic objects, combining optics, quantum effects, and special relativity. The project generates dynamic holograms, reconstructs 3D object fields, and visualizes entanglement metrics in real-time.

ðŸŒ€ **Fun fact:** To me, coding feels like wave interference, sometimes constructive, sometimes destructive but physics is always the best lens to reveal the hidden beauty of the universe.
## Abstract
We introduce an interactive, GPU-accelerated framework for real-time visualization of relativistic and quantum-informed holography. Our tool constructs point-cloud representations of canonical shapes (hypercube, spacetime torus, sphere) and applies full Lorentz transformations incorporating length contraction and Doppler-shifted quantum phasesâ€”to simulate their appearance in a moving reference frame. These transformed objects generate a phase-encoded hologram via angular spectrum propagation, which is then digitally reconstructed at user-defined distances. Eight synchronized panels display 3D rest- and moving-frame views, hologram intensity, reconstructed wavefront, Fourier spectrum, spacetime correlations, quantum phase maps, and entanglement entropy metrics. Responsive sliders for Î² = v/c and reconstruction distance, along with shape selectors and animation controls, deliver an immersive exploratory environment. By seamlessly integrating relativistic kinematics, quantum phase dynamics, and holographic imaging backed by optional CuPy GPU acceleration this project offers a powerful research and teaching platform for photonics, quantum information science, and high-energy optics.
